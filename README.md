Developing Data Products - Week 4 - Shiny App Assignment

This repository contains my Shiny Application - LMer

You can find the hosted App at:  https://johnsullivan2004.shinyapps.io/LMer/

**Usage of this Shiny app is simple:**
- Select the number of points you want in the "Number of Points" text box
- Use the slide to select "Distortion" (noise) from 0 to 100 (percent)
- Change the seed in the next text box
- Select the check box to turn the resulting fitted equation off/on

**Enjoy!**
